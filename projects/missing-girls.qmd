### Missing girls in historical Europe 

This research project studies whether discriminatory practices unduly increased female mortality during infancy and childhood in historical Europe  (c.1700-1950). More specifically, the project seeks to (1) trace the importance of missing girls, and thus the extent of discriminatory practices; (2) identify the type of families that were more likely to be involved in this kind of behaviour; and (3) highlight the factors that explain the variation in discriminatory practices across regions and over time. 

Funded by the Research Council of Norway (FRIPRO, 2020-2025). More info [here](https://sites.google.com/view/missing-girls-in-history/home).
