    "text": "Gifting a baby with a personal name is a universal cultural phenomenon that is attached with a profound symbolical value. Although the pool of potential names is theoretically infinite, the range of names traditionally used has been quite limited because the choice of a specific name was bound by existing cultural practices. In historical Europe, for instance, many children were named after their close relatives or cherished religious figures. The weight of tradition therefore implied that many individuals shared the same names, a circumstance that was transmitted across generations. Parents had nonetheless the last word and the degree to which they conform to those practices speaks a great deal about their cultural identity and preferences. Indeed, the stock and variety of names expanded, slowly and unevenly, from the 18th century onwards as the importance of religious considerations and the need to transmit names within families declined in response to the underlying societal changes that Europe was undergoing. Naming practices thus reflect the cultural context underpinning a particular society, together with the values and beliefs of the parents themselves, thus offering a unique opportunity to study cultural variation, persistence and change. Likewise, given that names provide crucial insights about parental values and beliefs, they can shed light on how cultural factors may have influenced the way parents raised their children (i.e. the care they devoted to their children, the importance they attached to education, etc.).\nThis project therefore uses the information contained in names as expressions of parental values and beliefs, as they signal the importance that families attached to religious values, family ties, political beliefs, and gender roles, among other dimensions. Relying on individual-level information contained in parish and civil registers and population censuses (and other historical sources), the project seeks to:\n\nTrace the relative importance of different naming practices in Europe (circa 1750-1950).\nAnalyse the dimensions that explain the variation in naming practices, not only across regions and over time, but also between families.\nExplore how culture helps shedding light on how parents raised their children and therefore shaped their individual outcomes (i.e. infant and child mortality, education, heights, marriage age, etc.).\n\nFunded by the Research Council of Norway (FRIPRO, 2026-2030)."

    "text": "I completed an MA in Economics at the University of Zaragoza (Spain) before pursuing a PhD in History at the University of Oxford (UK). My PhD thesis, which I defended in June 2014, studied the enclosing of the commons in 19th-century Spain. I then moved to Cambridge as a Junior Research Fellow at Magdalene College. During these three years at the University of Cambridge, my research interests expanded and I started to work on inequality, education, migrants’ selectivity, agglomeration economies and gender discrimination.\nSince 2017, I have been employed at the Department of Modern History and Society at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, first as an Associate Professor (Onsager Fellow), and then as Professor of Economic History. Here I have been involved in two research projects funded by the Research Council of Norway: Fate of Nations (2017-2024) and Missing girls in historical Europe (2020-2024). The latter, which I was the principal investigator, explores whether discriminatory practices unduly increased female mortality early in life in 19th and early-20th-century Europe. The project What was is a name? Culture and naming practices in the past, which I also lead, has just been granted funding by the Research Council of Norway (FRIPRO) for the period 2026-2030.\nTeaching is also a crucial component of my academic responsibilities. Since 2012, I have been teaching quantitative methods and GIS tools. Through lectures and hands-on computer sessions, my aim is to teach students with no statistical background how to apply these methods to their own research projects. I firmly believe that history students need to engage with computational tools in order to fully benefit from the ever-increasing availability of digital records, both numerical and textual."
